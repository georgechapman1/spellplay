MVP:
A lone spellcaster is the only defense to the attacking enemies.  Vulnerable, he has to stand behind village walls on the ramparts
so that he can cast his spells.  Once the wall is down, the village falls and the mission is failed.

Spellcasater has a projectile attack, that cost mana.  Mana replenishes over time, so he has to be accurate. He can move left and right.

Enemies spawn and approach the village wall that he has to defend. They have dynamite, so if they touch the wall they will immediately damage.
Three touches and village wall falls and games over.  Play wins by defending against enemies in a 2 minute round.
