SpellPLAY

MVP:
A lone spellcaster is the only defense to the attacking enemies.  Vulnerable, he has to stand behind village walls on the ramparts
so that he can cast his spells.  Once the wall is down, the village falls and the mission is failed.

Spellcasater has a projectile attack, that cost mana.  Mana replenishes over time, so he has to be accurate. He can move left and right.

Enemies spawn and approach the village wall that he has to defend. They have dynamite, so if they touch the wall they will immediately damage. They run in a straight line and span randomly, at increasing difficulty
Three touches and village wall falls and games over.  Play wins by defending against enemies in a 2 minute round.

Title page includes directions, storyline, and ability to start the game as shown on the screen to the right.  Once the gamer clicks start, they land on the screen to the light.

User has ability to move to the left and to the right to appropriately line up with the invading dynamite-bearing goblins.  As he spellcasts, his mana depletes, and he has to be careful with his mana pool.  If he runs low, he can consume a mana potion that replenishes 50 mana. As long as the wall stands (can take 3 suicidal goblin hits), gamer will progress through 5 rounds, each round gets hard as enemies begin to move faster and spawn faster.
